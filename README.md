# caijinglong
In principle, the warehouse under caijinglong follows the requirement of version number 2.0 of the semantic version.

But there are some special, destructive, incompatible API upgrade sub-version numbers before 1.0.0 rather than main version numbers.

Each warehouse follows its own LICENSE.
Most of them are MIT/APACHE/BSD.
